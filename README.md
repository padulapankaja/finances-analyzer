# Analyzing Personal Finances Locally with AI

Managing personal finances can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple credit and debit cards. Manually tracking and categorizing expenses from various transactions is not only tedious but also prone to errors.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers an efficient way to automate expense classification. However, using cloud-based AI solutions raises concerns about privacy, as financial data is highly sensitive. Fortunately, there’s a solution—running a Local Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and categorize transactions securely on your device.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to leverage local AI models, LLMs, and Python Panel to build a private financial dashboard for analyzing spending habits without exposing sensitive data to third-party services.

## Features
- **Local AI processing:** Ensures data privacy by keeping transactions on your device.
- **Automated expense categorization:** Uses an LLM to classify transactions into meaningful groups.
- **Interactive visualization:** Provides insights into spending patterns using Python Panel.
- **Customizable and extensible:** Adapt the system to different financial use cases.

## Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Panel
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Llama.cpp, GPT4All, or Mistral (for local LLM processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/local-finance-ai.git
   cd local-finance-ai
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
.


## Security Considerations
- Ensure that your local LLM is running in a secure environment.
- Keep your financial data encrypted when storing.
- Do not expose sensitive information in logs or outputs.
